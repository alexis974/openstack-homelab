# Homelab

The goal of this repository is to provide an overview of the different steps for deploying a production ready (from a software point of view) Openstack at home with [kolla-ansible](https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/zed/). This way, you will be able to have your very own private cloud.

# Acknowledgment

I would also like to thank [Sara Lafleur](https://github.com/SaraLafleur4) for the proofreading.

# Kolla-ansible

Everything regarding the installation and configuration of Openstack will be explained [here](./openstack/kolla/README.md)
